- ### Local Installation and Setup Guide:

    1. Clone the repository:
        ```
            git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/spend-guide-backend.git
        ```

    2. Configure the ```application.properties``` file:
        - Change the properties profile from production to local:
            From ```spring.profiles.active=production``` to ```spring.profiles.active=local```
        - Put app url and frontend url as your localhost then port number:
            The backend and frontend will most likely have port no.s 8080 and 5173 respectively.
            So, instead of this:
            ```
                app.base-url=${APP_BASE_URL}
                app.frontend-url=${FRONTEND_URL}
            ```
            put this:
            ```
                app.base-url=http://localhost:8080
                app.frontend-url=http://localhost:5173
            ```
        - Put your own secret key instead of ```${SECRET_KEY}```
        - Configure email service:
            1. Create new account in [Brevo‚Üó](https://www.brevo.com/)
            2. Get the API key, sender email address and sender name
            3. And put them instead of the env variable:
            ```
                brevo.apiKey=<put_your_api_key>
                brevo.sender=<put_the_sender_email>
                brevo.senderName=<put_the_sender_name>
            ```
        > For more info regarding Brevo API configuration, visit the [official documentation‚Üó](https://developers.brevo.com/docs/send-a-transactional-email)

    4. Build and run the development server:
        For windows powershell/terminal:
        ```
            .\mvnw spring-boot:run
        ```
        For mac/linux:
        ```
            ./mvnw spring-boot:run
        ```
